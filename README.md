Playing cards generator using ImageMagick

This bash script uses [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to draw a deck 
of 52 cards with a simplified design good for smartphones’ small screens. 

It draws:

1. A rectangular white background with rounded corners;
2. The card symbol (A, 2, …, J, Q, K);
3. The suit symbols (twice).
